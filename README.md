# 📋Rock Paper Scissors Game

![Alt text](img/overview.png?raw=true)

This is my own project to put my knowledge in JavaSciprt into practice. This Rock Paper Scissors game is play against computer. I mainly used functional JavaScript for the interactive parts. I built my own HTML and CSS as well.

## 💡 How to play

The main rule of the game is:

1. Player chooses a hand (rock, paper, or scissors) on the left to represent his/her choice.
2. The game starts by clicking the choice. The round counter will also start to accumulate the rounds.
3. The computer will also automatically deliver its choice for the battle.
4. It will tell the player if he/she has won, lost or tied the game.
5. If the player wants to restart the game anytime, he/she can click the return arrow button.
6. A solid winning star will be given to the winner. There is no star for both sides if the game is tied.
7. The one who get the 3 stars will be the winner.
8. A modal will pop up to conclude the player has won or lost the game in how many rounds.
9. Game will be restarted after clicking play again or X botton.
